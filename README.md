In this project, I show all the text pre processing and feature engineering that can be done on the 515k Hotel Reviews dataset. After all the feature engineering and data manipulation 
we run the Bag of Words model to extract text related features from the positive and negative reviews. These features can further be used for sentiment analysis, which will
be shown in the next project.
